# Directional Unit Hydrograph Model

This repository includes functions for implementing the Directional Unit Hydrograph model, featuring two key functions:

- WIUH.m: Computes hydrographs from Spatial Uniform events using the Width Function Unit Hydrograph.
- DWIUH.m: Computes hydrographs from rectangular moving storms using the Directional Width Function Unit Hydrograph.

For practical application, you can find an example in the 'run_example_DWIUH.m' file, demonstrating the model's use in the Turkey River basin—a watershed with a drainage area of 4,385 km², featuring the USGS gauge 05412500 at the watershed outlet
